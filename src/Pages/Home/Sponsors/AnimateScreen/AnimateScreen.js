/* 
    this is where i left off, i need to create a blue box here with the same layoutId as the AnimateBlock component
    i can make a transition animation when the AnimateBlock component is unmounted and create another transition
    animation for this component. it will make it seems as if the AnimateBlock is being moved to the middle of the screen

    i also need to fix some visual bugs on the AnimateBlock component

    also, make sure you give a static height to the Sponsors component
